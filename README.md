# Introduction

Background
My name is Mark Tyrell Christopher,born on March 8, 2002 in Indonesia where I lived since childhood years. 

Before and all throughout highschool,i've never had a stable hobby i pursued.I enjoyed eatching movies, reading books, and i played a fair amount of video games within my spare time along with my friends, but not excessively. During the grace period after graduating highschool,i've picked up digital art since i've had learned the basics from school.I'm also trying to explore video editing.
Education

I graduated high school in 2020 . Building on from that, I am currently a student at RMIT university studying the Bachelor of Information Technology.There's only one reason i came to study at RMIT,because i admired technology. To me,studying  technology in RMIT is a chance to not only discover more about the world of information and technology,but also discover more about myself,to become something i can be proud of.

Career Interest
Information Technology
Ever since i started thinking about what i want and the prospect of career came up,the Technology Industry was always in my mind.I explored my interests,researching many of the job fields offered,considering the potential pros/cons and what that would mean for me. After a considerable amount of thinking, i knew a job in the technology industry was what i desired, specifically in the video game industry.

After graduating highschool ,i knew i wanted to pursue higher education and decided that the bachlor of IT degree would be where i start.I also decided to go abroad very early on and upon further deliberation, RMIT was a choice that suits my interests.As i study at RMIT i want to work towards developing a skillset that is needed to work in the industry,from the technical skill needed to create an endproduct that realizes my goal and passion, but also the cooperation and teamwork management skills needed to work in groups . As I study at RMIT I want to develop skills that will enable me to achieve my goals and work with many people so i can start working on creating games from the start.

Ideal Job
Even during the times i weighed careers for myself, i've always had the idea that a job as a video game programmer and developer is what i wanted. Ever since a relative of mine showed me a full game they made with a small team when i was a little kid, i've been inspired by how much love and effort can be put into a single game.With a job in the industry,my vision is to share the way i enjoyed playing video games and inspire people like i've been inspired myself .A position as a video game programmer requires someone to have a background in IT including various programming languages, Write and fine-tune precise computer code that controls the difficulty level of a video game,implementation of artificial intelligence, and most importantly strong communications skills with team members to incorporate their vision into the game.

Test Results
The results of the tests will help describe who i am as a person and give a general idea of how i do things.It's a more or less accurate representation about myself .Though i'm somewhat carefree and free spirited and not a natural born leader, i would take any role to push along the group and move things forward, if i'm capable of course. Cooperation is very important and working on a common goal together is what cooperation means to me,not undermining a members effort and not leaving people behind for my own purpose.


Project Idea.
My Idea for a project is to complete an alpha phase of a 2d action platformer game that lets user interact with completed key gameplay elements without needing completed assets such as fully rendered textures and completed stage designs.This lets production of game features be implemented and tested and once the mechanics of the game have been solidified,it could be easily realized to a game with a full group.

Production of a game can be very tasking. It takes a full team of different aspects to fully flesh out a complete game and development might be costly.However,the building block of every game is of course the gameplay and rules that guides the player actions and its reaction.On a rudimentary level a game consists of interaction made within the world made inside the program. With limited resources, an endproduct of a complete game might not be achieved, but the entities that builds a game can still be made and polishing the mechanics of a game is  detrimental for a game's success. A game of a smaller scope would not achieve the same level of quality as a game produced by acompany with a group of a larger scale with more time put into it.So its detrimental to determine the scope and design the game around the capabilites that is achievable among the group.


As a start, an avatar that lets the player interact with the world would be implemented.The avatar would then be controlled with key presses on coresponding action buttons that is necessary to play the game such as move, jump,etc.The avatar would not have anywhere to go or any goals to achieve, but it can interact with various entities that can be placed around the avatar. These entities may include items, hazards, or non playable characters (NPC). They would have different properties and would interact uniquely with the avatar and one another.Some entities might harm the avatar, some might give the avatar unique effects, and others might give the avatar a benefit to help them.These elements can be pulled out and summoned at any area for testing and to see its constraints. 

The end goal of this execution is to more or less simulate interactions that would happen in the final endproduct game and have mechanics and rules of the game be defined so it can be applied throughout the development of the game.
