        <h2>Hello !</h2>
        <p>My name is Mark Tyrell Christopher,born on March 8, 2002 in Indonesia where I lived since childhood years.</p>
        <p>Before and all throughout highschool,i've never had a stable hobby i pursued.I enjoyed eatching movies, reading books, and i played a fair amount of video games within my spare time along with my friends, but not excessively. During the grace period after graduating highschool,i've picked up digital art since i've had learned the basics from school.I'm also trying to explore video editing.</P>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I graduated high school in 2020 . Building on from that, I am currently a student at RMIT university studying the Bachelor of Information Technology.There's only one reason i came to study at RMIT,because i admired technology. To me,studying  technology in RMIT is a chance to not only discover more about the world of information and technology,but also discover more about myself,to become something i can be proud of.</p>
