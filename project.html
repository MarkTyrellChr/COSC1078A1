    <h2>What i want to do! </h2>
    <h3>so what's the plan ? </h3>
    <p>My Idea for a project is to complete an alpha phase of a 2d action platformer game that lets user interact with completed key gameplay elements without needing completed assets such as fully rendered textures and completed stage designs.This lets production of game features be implemented and tested and once the mechanics of the game have been solidified,it could be easily realized to a game with a full group.</p>
    <p>Production of a game can be very tasking. It takes a full team of different aspects to fully flesh out a complete game and development might be costly.However,the building block of every game is of course the gameplay and rules that guides the player actions and its reaction.On a rudimentary level a game consists of interaction made within the world made inside the program. With limited resources, an endproduct of a complete game might not be achieved, but the entities that builds a game can still be made and polishing the mechanics of a game is  detrimental for a game's success. A game of a smaller scope would not achieve the same level of quality as a game produced by acompany with a group of a larger scale with more time put into it.So its detrimental to determine the scope and design the game around the capabilites that is achievable among the group.</p>
    <h3>What to do</h3>
    <p>As a start, an avatar that lets the player interact with the world would be implemented.The avatar would then be controlled with key presses on coresponding action buttons that is necessary to play the game such as move, jump,etc.The avatar would not have anywhere to go or any goals to achieve, but it can interact with various entities that can be placed around the avatar. These entities may include items, hazards, or non playable characters (NPC). They would have different properties and would interact uniquely with the avatar and one another.Some entities might harm the avatar, some might give the avatar unique effects, and others might give the avatar a benefit to help them.These elements can be pulled out and summoned at any area for testing and to see its constraints. </p>
    <p>The end goal of this execution is to more or less simulate interactions that would happen in the final endproduct game and have mechanics and rules of the game be defined so it can be applied throughout the development of the game.</p>
